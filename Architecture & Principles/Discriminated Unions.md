>In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), a **tagged union**, also called a **variant**, **variant record**, **choice type**, **discriminated union**, **[disjoint union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union "Disjoint union")**, **sum type** or **[coproduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coproduct "Coproduct")**, is a [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure "Data structure") used to hold a value that could take on several different, but fixed, types. Only one of the types can be in use at any one time, and a **tag** field explicitly indicates which one is in use. It can be thought of as a type that has several "cases", each of which should be handled correctly when that type is manipulated. This is critical in defining recursive datatypes, in which some component of a value may have the same type as that value, for example in defining a type for representing trees, where it is necessary to distinguish multi-node subtrees and leaves. Like ordinary [unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_type "Union type"), tagged unions can save storage by overlapping storage areas for each type, since only one is in use at a time.
