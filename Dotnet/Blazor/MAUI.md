If Maui is being a piece try installing the workloads:
```
sudo dotnet workload install maui-ios

sudo dotnet workload install maui-android

sudo dotnet workload install maui-maccatalyst
```

The errors that generally pop up from this are not being able to debug, and the XAML having pieces of it not being resolved like an Object not existing that definitely does exist
